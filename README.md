# Threat Detection Tool

## Overview

The **Threat Detection Tool** is a Python-based application designed to help monitor and detect potential security threats. This tool analyzes system logs, scans files for malware using YARA rules, and provides real-time alerts via Slack. It is ideal for detecting suspicious activity on a system, identifying malware, and sending alerts for security breaches.

## Features

- **Log Monitoring**: Continuously monitors system logs for suspicious activity.
- **Malware Detection**: Scans files for known malware using **YARA** rules.
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitors network activity for unusual traffic patterns.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Sends real-time notifications via **Slack** when potential threats are detected.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible for future use cases and security rule definitions.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the **Threat Detection Tool** up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites

Before running the tool, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: This tool is written in Python.
- **YARA**: The malware detection engine (for detecting known malware signatures).
- **Slack API Token**: For sending alerts to Slack when threats are detected.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   To get the project files, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/threatdetectiontool.git
   cd threatdetectiontool
2. **Configure Slack API**
   Create a Slack app and generate an incoming webhook URL: Create Slack App.
   Store your Slack webhook URL in an environment variable or configure it directly in the Python scripts.
   Alternatively, you can modify the send_alert function in the alerting.py script to use your own Slack webhook URL.

### Usage
- **Log Analysis**
  To begin analyzing system logs for suspicious activity, run:
  ```bash
  python3 log_analysis.py
- **Malware Detection**
  To scan files for known malware signatures using YARA rules, run:
  ```bash
  python3 malware_detection.py
- **Network Monitoring**
  To monitor network activity for unusual connections or traffic patterns, use:
  ```bash
  python3 network_monitoring.py
### How it Works
- **Log Monitoring**: The log_analysis.py script reads system logs (e.g., /var/log/) and checks for unusual or suspicious activities such as multiple failed login attempts or system errors.
- **Malware Detection**: The malware_detection.py script uses YARA rules to scan files for known malware signatures. You can create your own custom YARA rules to detect specific types of malware.
- **Network Monitoring**: The network_monitoring.py script monitors network traffic and identifies suspicious connections or high network usage patterns.
- **Alerts**: When any of these scripts detect potential threats, they will send a real-time alert to a configured Slack channel.
